##PART I: Collect and Describe the Data

Load the inspections dataset

```{r}

inspections <- read_csv("https://s3.amazonaws.com/notredame.analytics.data/inspections.csv")

glimpse(inspections)



```

Changing names and data types of the data in inspections

```{r}

inspections <- inspections %>%
  rename(ID = `Inspection ID`, DBANAME = `DBA Name`, AKANAME = `AKA Name`, License = `License #`,
         InspectionDate = `Inspection Date`,InspectionType = `Inspection Type`, 
         FacilityType = `Facility Type`, Risk = Risk, Address = Address, City = City, State = State) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.integer(ID), DBANAME = as.character(DBANAME), AKANAME = as.character(AKANAME), License = as.character(License), FacilityType = as.factor(FacilityType), Risk = as.factor(Risk), Address = as.character(Address), City = as.factor(City), State = as.factor(State),Zip = as.factor(Zip),Results = as.factor(Results), InspectionDate = as.character(InspectionDate), InspectionType = as.factor(InspectionType), Latitude = as.double(Latitude), Longitude = as.double(Longitude), Location = as.character(Location))
         


inspections$InspectionDate <- as.Date(inspections$InspectionDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

glimpse(inspections)


summary(inspections$City)

summary(inspections$State)

summary(inspections$Zip)

summary(inspections$InspectionDate)

summary(inspections$Longitude)

summary(inspections$Latitude)
```

##PART II: Resolve Data Quality Issues

Question: 1

```{r}
inspections$Zip[inspections$Zip == "60627"] <- "60827"

summary(inspections$Zip)
```



Question: 2

```{r}
inspections$City[inspections$City == "BRIDEVIEW"] <- "Bridgeview"

inspections$Zip[inspections$DBANAME == "STEVES 77 ICE CREAM"] <- "60455"

summary(inspections$City)

```


Question: 3

```{r}

##Besides STEVES 77 ICE CREAM, there are two other businesses with
##missing zip codes. To resolve these, letâ€™s assume that businesses on the same
##street or that are in close proximity to each other share the same zip code. Use
##this information to resolve the missing zip codes for the remaining two
##businesses.

##find what DBA NAmes have no zip code

inspections$DBANAME[is.na(inspections$Zip)]

##make Chartwells and Dunkin Donuts with no zip code 60455

inspections$Zip[inspections$DBANAME == "CHARTWELLS DINING SERVICES"] <- "60455"

inspections$Zip[inspections$DBANAME == "DUNKIN DONUTS"] <- "60455"

```
Question 4

```{r}
zipcodes <- read_csv("C:/Users//liamm/Downloads/zipcode.csv")

glimpse(zipcodes)
```
```{r}
##The reference dataset contains the city, state, latitude, and longitude data for
##most U.S. zip codes. It is sourced from the Civic Space Database. Use this
##dataset to resolve the inconsistent city names as well as the missing values for
##the City, State, Longitude, and Latitude features. It is safe to
##assume that all non-missing zip codes in the inspections dataset are
##accurate and that you can replace the city names in the inspections
##dataset with those from the reference dataset. Hint: A join would be useful
##here.
